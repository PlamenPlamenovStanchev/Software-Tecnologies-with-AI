    <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Solar Energy?</h2>
    <p>Solar energy is the energy from the sun that is converted into heat or electricity. It is a clean, renewable energy source that does not produce harmful emissions and is available in abundance across the planet.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Solar Energy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Renewable and sustainable energy source</li>
        <li>Reduces electricity bills and saves money</li>
        <li>Low maintenance costs</li>
        <li>Environmentally friendly with zero emissions</li>
        <li>Decreases dependence on fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Can work in various climates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Solar Energy Systems</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Photovoltaic (PV) Systems - Convert sunlight directly into electricity</li>
        <li>Solar Thermal Systems - Use the sun's heat for water heating</li>
        <li>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) - Uses mirrors to concentrate solar energy</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>How Do Solar Panels Work?</h2>
    <p>Solar panels contain photovoltaic cells that contain semiconductors, usually made of silicon. When sunlight hits these cells, it excites electrons, creating an electric current. An inverter then converts this direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC) that can power your home.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Components of a Solar System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Solar panels (photovoltaic modules)</li>
        <li>Inverter (converts DC to AC)</li>
        <li>Battery storage (optional)</li>
        <li>Mounting system</li>
        <li>Electrical wiring and equipment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Global Solar Energy Growth</h2>
    <p>Solar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources worldwide. Many countries have set ambitious targets to increase solar energy capacity as part of their transition to clean energy. Solar installations continue to increase on both residential and commercial properties.</p>
